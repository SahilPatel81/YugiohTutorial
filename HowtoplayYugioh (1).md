
## The Greatest Yugioh Tutorial Ever

Yugioh is a world famous card game known for its complexity. This tutorial will try to explain how to play Yugioh in a simple manner, so you can have your first duel.

# 1. Normal summon a monster
- During each of your turns you are allowed to normal summon 1 monster
- The monster must be level 4 or below. Levels are indicated by the Yellow/Orange stars on top of the card
- Simply place the monster in the monster zone
- On websites they usually help show where monsterzones are, and most playmats also indicate the zones

# 2. Tribute Summon a monster
- Tribute summons are a subset of normal summons required for cards higher than level 4
- Levels 5 and 6 require 1 tribute, and 7 or higher require 2 tributes
- Tributes mean other monsters on your side of the field you send to your graveyard
- Tribute summons are also once per turn!

# 3. Special Summon a monster
- Special summons, unlike normal summons, have unlimited uses each turn
- The requirements for special summons are usually specified on the card itself

# 4. Spell cards
- Spell cards are indicated by their color. While monsters are usually brown, spel cards are green
- Some spells have requirements to activate, indicated on the card, but many are free to use!
- Spells have a wide array of uses, from increasing attack points, to destroying monsters your opponent controls

# 5. Trap cards
- Trap cards are indicated by their purple color
- Trap cards also have a wide array of effects like Spell cards
- The difference between Spell and Trap cxards is that spell cards can be used during your turn, while trap cards must be placed or "set" face down in a spell/trap zone and must wait until the turn is over to activate
- You can use trap cards to counter or "trap" your opponents during their turn to disrupt their play
- Some trap cards also have requiremenst to activate specified on their text

# 6. Extra Deck monsters
- Extra deck monsters are placed in the extra deck, which consists of around 10-15 cards, compared to teh main decks 40-60 cards
- Extra deck monsters consist of 5 major types: Fusion, Synchro, XYZ, Pendulem, and Links
- We will focus on the Fusion and XYZ since Synchros, Pendulem and Link monsters are a bit complicated
- Fusion monsters are colored purple, and can be summoned via the spell card "Polymerization". By activating the card and sending the required monsters listed on the fusion monster to the graveyard, you can summon that monster
- XYZ monsters are summoned by "overlaying"(stacking) 2 monsters with the same level on top of each other, summoning an xyz monster with the same "rank"
- Ranks are indicated by the black stars on top of an xyz monster, similar to levels
- For example, overlaying 2 level 4 monsters allows you to summon one rank 4 xyz monster
- Extra deck monsters are typically the strongest monsters in your possession

# 7. Rules
- Here are some basic rules to learn
- Each player gets 4000 to 8000 lifepoints
- Lowering your opponents lifepoints to 0 wins you the duel. This can be done via attacking with monsters, in which case the lifepoints go down equal to the monsters attack points
- You can destroy the opponents monsters by attacking as well with a monster with higher attack points, in which case the difference in attack is sent as lifepoint damage
- Defense is used when a monster is in defense position. This allows for the opponent to not lose life points even if the monster is destroyed, however you can't attack with a defense position monster
- The graveyard is where destroyed cards go
- At the start of each game you take the top 5 cards of your deck in your hand. The "hand" is the pool of yards you are allowed to use during that turn. At teh start of each of your turns you draw 1 card from the top of your deck to add to your hand.
